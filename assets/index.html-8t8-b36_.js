To unlock these features while ensuring compatibility across platforms, the build process is a key part of the workflow.</p><p>Every Stone.js project goes through a build step, not because it&#39;s optional, but because it uses the <strong>latest ECMAScript features</strong>. The framework uses <strong>Rollup</strong> and <strong>Babel</strong> to compile backend code, and <strong>Vite</strong> and <strong>Babel</strong> to bundle frontend code. These tools are preconfigured but fully exportable if you need customization.</p><p>In dev mode, use <code>npm run dev</code> to iterate with live rebuilds.<br> For production, run <code>npm run build</code> to get a single artifact ready to deploy, to Node.js, a browser, or even a Function-as-a-Service like AWS Lambda.</p><p>Everything needed to configure, bootstrap, and launch the app is generated or configurable, and Stone.js gives you full control when you need it, with built-in safety when you don’t.</p><h2 id="run-phase-at-a-glance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#run-phase-at-a-glance"><span>Run Phase (At a Glance)</span></a></h2><p>Once built, the runtime takes over.
