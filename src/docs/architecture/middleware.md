title: Middleware
---

In Stone.js, middleware is how you **act on the internal context**.

Unlike [Hooks](./lifecycle), which observe and react, middleware **participates directly** in the flow. It can **intercept, transform, short-circuit**, or fully redirect the system’s behavior as it unfolds across dimensions.

Middleware is always **dimension-specific**, but its structure remains consistent. It gives you the power to shape both the **creation** and the **execution** of context, making it one of the most expressive tools in the framework.

This page focuses on **Initialization middleware**, which operates at the kernel or route level, where intentions are fully formed and ready to meet the domain. It’s where most user-level logic lives, and where middleware becomes your primary tool to **control the interaction between context and domain logic**.

::: tip
The principles described here apply to **all middleware**, regardless of dimension.  
Even if you’re working with Integration or Setup middleware, this page lays the foundation.  
For dimension-specific details, refer to the [Blueprint](../blueprint) and [Adapter](../adapter) documentation.
:::

Middleware is how you shape the continuum **from within**. Use it intentionally, and use it often.

## Using Middleware

In Stone.js, all middleware follow a **shared structure**, no matter which dimension they belong to. This structural consistency is a core part of the Continuum Architecture: **only the context and return type change**, the shape remains the same.

Whether you're enriching a blueprint, transforming an adapter’s raw input, or intercepting a request before it reaches the domain, middleware always receives a **context**, a `next()` function, and must return a result.

Stone.js supports three interchangeable middleware variants:

- **Class-based**, required when using the Declarative API with decorators
- **Function-based**, simple, flexible, ideal for functional or imperative registration
- **Factory-based**, dynamic and dependency-aware, used when function-based middleware needs to be parameterized or contextualized

You can use any of these shapes in **any dimension**. The continuum doesn’t restrict you, it empowers you to choose what fits best.

### Middleware Signature

All middleware in Stone.js share the **same function signature**, regardless of the dimension they operate in:

```ts
const middleware = <ContextType, ReturnType>(
  context: ContextType,
  next: NextMiddleware<ContextType, ReturnType>
): ReturnType => {}
```

Each middleware receives:
- A `context`: the dimension-specific data for that phase (e.g. `IncomingHttpEvent`, `BlueprintContext`, etc.)
- A `next()` function: used to forward the context to the next middleware in the chain
- A return value: either the result of `next()` or a short-circuited custom response

The middleware can:
- **Mutate** the context before calling `next()`
- **Intercept and modify** the result after `next()` returns
- **Short-circuit** the flow by returning early (e.g. an error response)
- **Break the chain** entirely by throwing an exception

This structure makes middleware expressive, composable, and highly controllable, regardless of where it runs in the continuum.

### Middleware Variants

Stone.js middleware can be written in three interchangeable forms: **class**, **function**, or **factory**.  
Each variant provides the same capabilities and can be used in any dimension, choose the shape that best fits your design or context.

@tab:active Class-based
#### Class-based Middleware

In class-based middleware, you implement a `handle()` method.  
This form is compatible with the Declarative API and supports dependency injection via the constructor.

```ts
import { IMiddleware, NextMiddleware } from '@stone-js/core'
import { IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse } from '@stone-js/http-core'

export class MyMiddleware implements IMiddleware<IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse> {
  private readonly userService: UserService

  // Destructuring dependencies injection from the container
  constructor({ userService }: { userService: UserService }) {
    this.userService = userService
  }
  
  async handle(
    event: IncomingHttpEvent,
    next: NextMiddleware<IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse>
  ): Promise<OutgoingHttpResponse> {
    // Add contextual info
    const user = await this.userService.getUser(event.get('user-id'))
    event.setUserResolver(() => user)

    // Short-circuit if missing header
    if (!event.hasHeader('X-Request-ID')) {
      return OutgoingHttpResponse.create(
        { status: 400, content: 'Missing X-Request-ID header' }
      )
    }

    // Break the flow completely
    if (event.getUser()?.role !== 'admin') {
      throw new UnauthorizedError('Unauthorized')
    }

    // Continue
    const response = await next(event)

    // Add header to result
    response.setHeader('X-Request-ID', event.getHeader('X-Request-ID'))

    return response
  }
}
```

Use this shape when working with decorators or when you want access to constructor-injected dependencies.

@tab Function-based
#### Function-based Middleware

Function-based middleware is concise, expressive, and ideal for functional use cases or manual registration.

```ts
import { NextMiddleware } from '@stone-js/core'
import { IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse } from '@stone-js/http-core'

export const MyMiddleware = async (
  event: IncomingHttpEvent,
  next: NextMiddleware<IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse>
): Promise<OutgoingHttpResponse> => {
  event.setUserResolver(() => ({ name: 'John Doe' }))

  return await next(event)
}
```

Function middleware offers full control with minimal boilerplate, and is preferred for most imperative scenarios.

@tab Factory-based
#### Factory-based Middleware

Use a factory when your function-based middleware needs to receive configuration or services from the container.

```ts
import { NextMiddleware } from '@stone-js/core'
import { IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse } from '@stone-js/http-core'

export const createUserResolverMiddleware = ({ userService }: { userService: UserService }) => async (
  event: IncomingHttpEvent,
  next: NextMiddleware<IncomingHttpEvent, OutgoingHttpResponse>
): Promise<OutgoingHttpResponse> => {
  const user = await userService.getUser(event.get('user-id'))
  event.setUserResolver(() => user)

  const result = await next(event)
  return result
}
```

This shape is useful when you need dynamic logic based on runtime conditions, environment, or resolved services, without using a class.

:::

### Why call `next()`

Calling `next()` signals that your middleware has finished its work and the context should proceed to the next middleware in the chain, or to the final handler if none remain.  
Every middleware **must return a value**, either by returning early, forwarding the result of `next()`, or throwing an error.

This mechanism gives you full control over the execution flow:

#### 1. Modify the context before continuing

Mutate the context before forwarding it to the next step.

```ts
event.setUserResolver(() => user)
```

Here, we attach the user to the `IncomingHttpEvent` before it reaches the handler.

#### 2. Short-circuit the middleware chain

Return early without calling `next()` to skip the rest of the chain.

```ts
if (!event.hasHeader('X-Request-ID')) {
  return OutgoingHttpResponse.create(
    { status: 400, content: 'Missing X-Request-ID header' }
  )
}
```

Middleware must always return an `OutgoingResponse` or a subclass of it. In this case, we return a `400` response and prevent the handler from running.

#### 3. Break the flow entirely

Throw an error to stop execution.

```ts
if (event.getUser()?.role !== 'admin') {
  throw new UnauthorizedError('Unauthorized')
}
```

This halts the pipeline and triggers error handling logic.

#### 4. Act after the rest of the chain

Capture and modify the result after downstream middleware or the handler.

```ts
const result = await next(event)
result.setHeader('X-Request-ID', event.getHeader('X-Request-ID'))
return result
```

This lets you wrap, modify, or augment the final response before it leaves the system.

This simple yet powerful pattern is what makes middleware composable, interruptible, and expressive across all dimensions.

### Sync or Async? Both.

Middleware can be **synchronous** or **asynchronous**, as long as it returns the appropriate value.  
Stone.js handles middleware flow seamlessly, so you're free to mix sync and async styles without friction.

### Use Any Variant, in Any Dimension

Stone.js does not restrict middleware variants by dimension.

You can use:
- **Class-based** middleware
- **Function-based** middleware
- **Factory-based** middleware

…in any dimension:
- [Setup](./blueprint#dynamic-configuration)
- Integration
- Initialization

The only difference is the **context and return type**, which are defined by the dimension itself.

**Continuum means flexibility**, choose the shape that suits your logic, and let the system adapt to it.

## Middleware Registration

Once your middleware is defined, it needs to be **registered** so Stone.js can discover and execute it at the appropriate point in the system lifecycle.

There are two ways to register middleware:

- **Declarative API**, via decorators on class-based middleware
- **Imperative API**, via the blueprint, using namespace keys and metadata

::: code-tabs#declarative-imperative
@tab:active Declarative
### Declarative API

To register middleware declaratively, use the `@Middleware()` decorator:

```ts
import { Middleware } from '@stone-js/core'

@Middleware()
export class MyMiddleware {}
```

The decorator is only available for **class-based** middleware and must be used within modules discovered by the blueprint.

You can also pass options to control its behavior (see below).

@tab Imperative

### Imperative API

To register middleware imperatively, add them directly to the blueprint under the `stone.kernel.middleware` namespace.

```ts
import { defineBlueprintConfig } from '@stone-js/core'

export const mainBlueprint = defineBlueprintConfig((blueprint) => {
  blueprint.add('stone.kernel.middleware', [{ module: MyMiddleware }])
})
```

This approach gives you full flexibility and supports **function-based**, **factory-based**, and **class-based** middleware, with shape metadata.
:::

### Priority and Execution Order

Stone.js executes middleware in the order they are defined, unless you specify a `priority`.

- Lower values run first (`priority: 0` runs before `priority: 10`)
- If no priority is defined, middleware are executed in registration order

::: code-tabs#declarative-imperative
@tab:active Declarative

```ts
@Middleware({ priority: 10 })
export class MyMiddleware {}
```

@tab Imperative

```ts
blueprint.set('stone.kernel.middleware', [
  { module: MyMiddleware, priority: 10 }
])
```
:::

### Middleware Options

Whether registered declaratively or imperatively, you can configure middleware using the following options:

```ts
export interface MiddlewareOptions {
  alias?: string | string[]
  priority?: number
  global?: boolean
}
```

**A complete example:**

::: code-tabs#declarative-imperative
@tab:active Declarative

```ts
@Middleware({ priority: 10, alias: 'auth', global: true })
export class MyMiddleware {}
```

@tab Imperative

```ts
blueprint.set('stone.kernel.middleware', [
  { module: MyMiddleware, priority: 10, alias: 'auth', global: true }
])
```
:::

#### `alias`
A named identifier you can use to reference the middleware later, for example, in route definitions:
```ts
@Get({ middleware: ['auth'] })
```

#### `global`
Set to `true` to apply this middleware to **all IncomingEvent executions** by default.  
If omitted or `false`, the middleware is considered **route-specific** and must be explicitly referenced.

## Best Practices

Middleware is one of the most flexible and expressive features in Stone.js, but with great power comes great opportunity for chaos. Follow these guidelines to get the most out of your middleware design while keeping your system clean, scalable, and continuum-aligned.

#### Keep Middleware Single-Purpose

Each middleware should do **one thing well**.

Good:
- One middleware for authentication
- Another for input validation
- Another for response shaping

Avoid building "mega-middleware" that tries to handle multiple unrelated concerns.

#### Don’t Skip the Return

Every middleware **must return a value**, either:
- A custom response
- The result of `next(context)`
- Or throw an error

Returning `undefined` will break the chain and can result in runtime errors.

#### Use `next()` with Intention

Call `next()` only when you're ready to pass control forward.  
Modify the context before it, and the result after it, but avoid calling it conditionally or in multiple branches unless absolutely necessary.

#### Use Aliases for Reusability

Register middleware with an `alias` to reuse it across routes declaratively.

```ts
@Middleware({ alias: 'auth' })
```

Then reference it in routes:

```ts
@Post({ middleware: ['auth'] })
```

#### Use `global` When Appropriate

Global middleware applies to **all intentions**(`IncomingEvent`). Use this for:
- Logging
- Security headers
- Feature toggles

Avoid `global: true` for logic that only applies to a subset of routes or domains.

#### Choose the Right Shape

- Use **class-based middleware** when you rely on the Declarative API
- Use **function-based middleware** for quick, clear logic
- Use **factory-based middleware** for dynamic, parameterized logic or need DI

All shapes are valid, choose based on context, not preference.

#### Avoid Cross-Dimensional Confusion

Keep dimension-specific logic in its place:
- Use **Setup middleware** for configuration
- Use **Integration middleware** for transforming raw input
- Use **Initialization middleware** for per-intention logic
- Use [**Hooks**](./lifecycle) for passive observation
- Use **Middleware** for active transformation
- Use **Blueprint** for system-wide configuration
- Follow the lifecycle, middleware is powerful because it's scoped

## Summary

Middleware in Stone.js gives you the power to **actively shape the flow of your system**, from the moment an intention is created to the point a response is returned.

In this document, we focused on **initialization middleware**, the most common type used to handle per-intention logic like authentication, validation, and context enrichment. But the same principles apply across all dimensions.

**Key takeaways:**
- Middleware always receives a `context`, a `next()` function, and must return a value
- You can write middleware as a **class**, **function**, or **factory**
- Stone.js supports both **Declarative** (via decorators) and **Imperative** (via blueprint) registration
- Middleware can mutate, intercept, short-circuit, or wrap the execution, giving you full control
- Always return a result and keep middleware **single-responsibility and focused**
- Use `alias` and `global` for composability and reuse

When you need to **transform** the system, use middleware.  
When you only need to **observe**, use [Hooks](./lifecycle).  
The dimension defines the context. The shape is your choice.  
That’s the continuum.
