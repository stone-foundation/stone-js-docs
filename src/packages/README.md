  - header: Stone.js Packages

    description: >
      This section contains direct access to **package-level documentation** for various tools, adapters, and core utilities used in the Stone.js ecosystem.  
      These packages are essential to how Stone.js runs across environments, from the browser to Node.js, AWS Lambda to CLI tools.

      Each package listed here links to its raw `README.md`, maintained at the source level.  
      Use this section to go deeper into advanced use cases, configuration options, and specific integration scenarios **not yet covered** in the core API documentation.

      This separation keeps the main documentation clean and structured, while still giving you full access to everything under the hood.
