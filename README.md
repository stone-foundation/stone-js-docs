Welcome to the official documentation source for [Stone.js](https://stonejs.com), the universal JavaScript/TypeScript framework built on the **Continuum Architecture**.

This repository powers the [documentation site](https://stonejs.com), built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), and serves as the single source of truth for all developer guides, API references, core concepts, and advanced features of Stone.js.

## What Is Stone.js?

Stone.js is a **next-generation framework** that lets you build:

- Backend apps (microservices, CLI, serverless)
- Frontend apps (SPA, SSR, Vue/React)
- Fullstack cloud-native applications

All using **one architecture**, **one mental model**, and **one toolchain**.

At the heart of Stone.js is the **Continuum Architecture**, where everything is a context, and the same knowledge applies across dimensions, backend, frontend, serverless, browser, anywhere.

## Project Structure

This documentation is organized using the [Stone.js Documentation Master Plan](https://github.com/stonemjs/docs), which defines a consistent structure for all pages.

You‚Äôll find every page follows a shared structure:

* Introduction
* Where it fits in the Continuum Architecture
* Feature shape (class/function/factory)
* Dimension-specific behavior
* Declarative & imperative registration
* Best practices
* Summary

## About the Continuum Architecture

Stone.js is more than a framework, it‚Äôs a new way to build software systems.

At the core of Stone.js is a radical but practical idea:

> **‚ÄúContext defines everything.‚Äù**
